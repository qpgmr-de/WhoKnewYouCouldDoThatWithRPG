# Who Knew You Could Do That With RPG?

A community approach to create a modern version of the 
[IBM Redbook "Who Knew You Could Do That with RPG IV?"](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245402.pdf)
from 2016.

<a href="../../wiki">Start here at the Wiki</a>

</p>

The basic idea is, to write the new "book" in the wiki section of this repository 
and commit code snippets and examples into the repository itself.

Everyone is invited to contribute - contact me to be added as a collaborator.
